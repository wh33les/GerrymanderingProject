      Other_Citation_Details:
        CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_113TH_USCB_IN.SHP was derived by modification of a preexisting shapefile named REDISTRICTING_INDIANA_CONGRESSIONAL_DISTRICTS.SHP.
        The redistricted boundaries were provided to the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) by the Indiana Election Division (IED) in May, 2011.
        The redistricted boundaries are the new U.S. Congressional Districts for Indiana for 2011 through 2021.

        Personnel of the IGS added the names and contact information for each of Indiana's nine representatives for the 113th U.S Congress to this dataset.
        The information was obtained from the official Web sites for each representative, which were obtained from http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/IN

  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set shows the newly redistricted boundaries (adopted in May 2011) of Indiana's nine districts for the 113th U.S. Congress and provides
      the name, party affiliation, and additional contact information for each of the representatives.

      NOTE: Redistricting of all Indiana legislative boundaries were adopted in May 2011, and will be used from 2011 through 2021.
      Republicans who controlled the Indiana House and Senate from the 117th General Assembly oversaw the drawing of new maps in the Spring of 2011 for all 100
      state house and 50 state senate districts and Indiana's nine congressional seats. New political districts are drawn every 10 years to incorporate information
      from the latest U.S. Census.
    Purpose: CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_113TH_USCB_IN.SHP was created to provide a GIS data layer of the Indiana districts of the 113th congress.

        CD18_108_SHP.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped.
        ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on CD18_108.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
        (Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
        was named CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_108TH_USCB_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
        dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "CD18_108_," "CD18_108_I," "State," "LSAD," "LSAD_TRANS," and "NAME."

        The following fields were then added to CONGRESS_DISTRICTS_108TH_USCB_IN.SHP: "Representa," "Party," "Web_Site," "E_Mail,"
